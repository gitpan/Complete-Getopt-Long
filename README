NAME
    Complete::Getopt::Long - Complete command-line argument using
    Getopt::Long specification

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.14 of Complete::Getopt::Long (from
    Perl distribution Complete-Getopt-Long), released on 2014-09-04.

SYNOPSIS
    See Getopt::Long::Complete for an easy way to use this module.

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  complete_cli_arg(%args) -> array|hash
    Complete command-line argument using Getopt::Long specification.

    This routine can complete option names, where the option names are
    retrieved from "Getopt::Long" specification. If you provide completion
    routine in "completion", you can also complete *option values* and
    *arguments*.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   completion => *code*

        Completion routine to complete option value/argument.

        Completion code will receive a hash of arguments containing these
        keys:

        *   "type" (str, what is being completed, either "optname",
            "optval", or "arg")

        *   "word" (str, word to be completed)

        *   "opt" (str, option name, e.g. "--str"; undef if we're completing
            argument)

        *   "ospec" (str, Getopt::Long option spec, e.g. "str|S=s"; undef
            when completing argument)

        *   "argpos" (int, argument position, zero-based; undef if
            completing option)

        *   "extras"

        *   "seen_opts" (hash, all the options seen in "words")

        and is expected to return a completion reply in the form of array.
        The various "complete_*" function like those in "Complete::Util" or
        the other "Complete::*" modules are suitable to use here.

        Code can also return undef, in which the default completion routine
        is called. It completes from environment variables ($foo), usernames
        ("~foo"), and files.

        Example:

         use Complete::Unix qw(complete_user);
         use Complete::Util qw(complete_array_elem);
         complete_cli_arg(
             getopt_spec =E<gt> {
                 'help|h'   =E<gt> sub{...},
                 'format=s' =E<gt> \$format,
                 'user=s'   =E<gt> \$user,
             },
             completion  =E<gt> sub {
                 my %args  = @_;
                 my $word  = $args{word};
                 my $ospec = $args{ospec};
                 if ($ospec && $ospec eq 'format=s') {
                     complete_array(array=E<gt>[qw/json text xml yaml/], word=E<gt>$word);
                 } else {
                     complete_user(word=E<gt>$word);
                 }
             },
         );

    *   cword* => *int*

        Index in words of the word we're trying to complete.

        See function "parse_cmdline" in "Complete::Bash" on how to produce
        this (if you're using bash).

    *   extras => *hash*

        To pass extra arguments to completion routines.

    *   getopt_spec* => *hash*

        Getopt::Long specification.

    *   words* => *array*

        Command line arguments, like @ARGV.

        See function "parse_cmdline" in "Complete::Bash" on how to produce
        this (if you're using bash).

    Return value:

     (any)

    You can use `format_completion` function in `Complete::Bash` module to
    format the result of this function for bash.
