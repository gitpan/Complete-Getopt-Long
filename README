NAME
    Complete::Getopt::Long - Complete command-line argument using
    Getopt::Long specification

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.24 of Complete::Getopt::Long (from
    Perl distribution Complete-Getopt-Long), released on 2014-12-27.

SYNOPSIS
    See Getopt::Long::Complete for an easy way to use this module.

DESCRIPTION
    Note that I deliberately do not support "ci" (case-insensitive) option
    here. Options that differ only in case often are often and they mean
    different things.

FUNCTIONS
  complete_cli_arg(%args) -> array|hash
    Complete command-line argument using Getopt::Long specification.

    This routine can complete option names, where the option names are
    retrieved from "Getopt::Long" specification. If you provide completion
    routine in "completion", you can also complete *option values* and
    *arguments*.

    Note that this routine does not use "Getopt::Long" (it does its own
    parsing) and currently is not affected by Getopt::Long's configuration.
    Its behavior mimics Getopt::Long under these configuration: "bundling",
    "no_ignore_case". Which I think is the sensible default. This routine
    also does not currently support "auto_help" and "auto_version", so
    you'll need to add those options specifically if you want to recognize
    "--help/-?" and "--version", respectively.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   completion => *code*

        Completion routine to complete option value/argument.

        Completion code will receive a hash of arguments (%args) containing
        these keys:

        *   "type" (str, what is being completed, either "optval", or "arg")

        *   "word" (str, word to be completed)

        *   "cword" (int, position of words in the words array, starts from
            0)

        *   "opt" (str, option name, e.g. "--str"; undef if we're completing
            argument)

        *   "ospec" (str, Getopt::Long option spec, e.g. "str|S=s"; undef
            when completing argument)

        *   "argpos" (int, argument position, zero-based; undef if
            type='optval')

        *   "nth" (int, the number of times this option has seen before,
            starts from 0 that means this is the first time this option has
            been seen; undef when type='arg')

        *   "seen_opts" (hash, all the options seen in "words")

        as well as all keys from "extras" (but these won't override the
        above keys).

        and is expected to return a completion answer structure as described
        in "Complete" which is either a hash or an array. The simplest form
        of answer is just to return an array of strings. The various
        "complete_*" function like those in "Complete::Util" or the other
        "Complete::*" modules are suitable to use here.

        Completion routine can also return undef to express declination, in
        which case the default completion routine will then be consulted.
        The default routine completes from shell environment variables
        ($FOO), Unix usernames ("~foo"), and files/directories.

        Example:

         use Complete::Unix qw(complete_user);
         use Complete::Util qw(complete_array_elem);
         complete_cli_arg(
             getopt_spec => {
                 'help|h'   => sub{...},
                 'format=s' => \$format,
                 'user=s'   => \$user,
             },
             completion  => sub {
                 my %args  = @_;
                 my $word  = $args{word};
                 my $ospec = $args{ospec};
                 if ($ospec && $ospec eq 'format=s') {
                     complete_array(array=>[qw/json text xml yaml/], word=>$word);
                 } else {
                     complete_user(word=>$word);
                 }
             },
         );

    *   cword* => *int*

        Index in words of the word we're trying to complete.

        See function "parse_cmdline" in "Complete::Bash" on how to produce
        this (if you're using bash).

    *   extras => *hash*

        Add extra arguments to completion routine.

        The keys from this "extras" hash will be merged into the final %args
        passed to completion routines. Note that standard keys like "type",
        "word", and so on as described in the function description will not
        be overwritten by this.

    *   getopt_spec* => *hash*

        Getopt::Long specification.

    *   words* => *array*

        Command line arguments, like @ARGV.

        See function "parse_cmdline" in "Complete::Bash" on how to produce
        this (if you're using bash).

    Return value:

     (any)

    You can use "format_completion" function in "Complete::Bash" module to
    format the result of this function for bash.

TODO
    Handle redirection and other bash syntax. When command-line is 'foo 1 2
    </some/path' bash will supply COMP_WORDS as (foo 1 2 < /some/path). We
    currently do not yet specifically handle this.
