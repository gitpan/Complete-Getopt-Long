SYNOPSIS

    See Getopt::Long::Complete for an easy way to use this module.

DESCRIPTION

    Note that I deliberately do not support ci (case-insensitive) option
    here. Options that differ only in case often are often and they mean
    different things.

TODO

    Handle redirection and other bash syntax. When command-line is 'foo 1 2
    </some/path' bash will supply COMP_WORDS as (foo 1 2 < /some/path). We
    currently do not yet specifically handle this.
