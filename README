NAME
    Complete::Getopt::Long - Complete command-line argument using
    Getopt::Long specification

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.03 of Complete::Getopt::Long (from
    Perl distribution Complete-Getopt-Long), released on 2014-07-24.

SYNOPSIS
    See Getopt::Long::Complete for an easy way to use this module.

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  complete_cli_arg(%args) -> array|hash
    Complete command-line argument using Getopt::Long specification.

    Examples:

     complete_cli_arg(
       cword => 0,
       getopt_spec => {
         "arg1|a=s" => sub { ... },
         "arg2|b=s" => sub { ... },
         "help|h"   => sub { ... },
       },
       words => []
     );

    Result: "["--arg1", "--arg2", "--help", "-a", "-b", "-h"]".

    This routine can complete option names, where the option names are
    retrieved from "Getopt::Long" specification. If you provide completion
    hints in "hints", you can also complete option *values* and *arguments*.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   completion => *hash*

        Completion routines for complete option values/arguments.

        The keys are option spec, like in "getopt_spec". To refer to
        arguments, use '' (empty string). The values are either arrayrefs
        (to specify valid values) or a coderefs to supply custom completion.
        Completion code will receive a hash of arguments containing these
        keys: "word" (word to be completed) and is expected to return a
        completion reply in the form of array. The various "complete_*"
        function like those in "Complete::Util" or the other "Complete::*"
        modules are suitable to use here. Example:

         require Complete::Unix;
         complete_cli_arg(
             getopt_spec =E<gt> {
                 'help|h'   =E<gt> sub{...},
                 'format=s' =E<gt> \$fmt,
                 'user=s'   =E<gt> \$user,
             },
             completion  =E<gt> {
                 'format=s' =E<gt> ['json', 'text', 'xml', 'yaml'],
                 'user=s'   =E<gt> \&Complete::Unix::complete_user,
             },
         );

    *   cword* => *int*

        Index in words of the word we're trying to complete.

        See function "parse_cmdline" in "Complete::Bash" on how to produce
        this (if you're using bash).

    *   getopt_spec* => *hash*

        Getopt::Long specification.

    *   words* => *array*

        Command line, already broken into words.

        See function "parse_cmdline" in "Complete::Bash" on how to produce
        this (if you're using bash).

    Return value:

     (any)

    You can use `format_completion` function in `Complete::Bash` module to
    format the result of this function for bash.
